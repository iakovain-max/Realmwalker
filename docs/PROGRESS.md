## M0 — Setup (done)

**What you can do now**
- Double-click `Play.bat`. A window opens (maximized) with the title screen and menu.
- **Player2 Connection Test** (press `P`): shows whether Player2 is running, the health ping,
  your remaining AI energy, and request counts. Press `G` to have the AI write a sample tavern
  (name, sign, description, keeper, a line of overheard talk). Press `O` to pretend Player2 is
  closed and see the built-in text instead, or actually close Player2 and press `G`.
- **Settings** (`S`): text size, fullscreen, dice display, AI on/off, text detail, autosave, AI debug log.
- Anywhere: `Ctrl +` / `Ctrl -` text size, `F11` fullscreen, `F12` screenshot, `F1` help.
- `Build_For_Friends.bat` makes `Realmwalker.zip` (about 34 MB). Friends unzip and double-click `Realmwalker.exe`.

**How it was verified**
- 109 automated tests pass (dice, RNG, data validation, AI parsing and fallback, AI service against a fake
  Player2 server in every failure mode, all screens at four window sizes, error recovery, settings).
- Autoplay bot: 3000 turns with AI off and 3000 with a deliberately unreliable fake AI — no errors.
- Real window opened and toured by the smoke test; `Play.bat` launched it; the packaged `.exe` started too.
- One real Player2 generation succeeded: *"The Wet Whetstone"*, keeper Ragnvald Ormsson, a carter
  "found under the switchbacks, throat cut and boots gone" (784 tokens, ~8 s, ~2 energy).

**Decisions (and why)**
1. **Player2 via the local app API, no client ID.** The local API works without one; the header is supported
   if a client ID is ever put in `config.json`. Simplest for you and for friends.
2. **No `response_format` JSON mode** — with it, the current Player2 model returned empty replies. We ask for
   JSON in the prompt and parse it defensively instead.
3. **Generous token allowance (3000) for AI requests.** The model "thinks" silently before answering; with a
   900 cap it thought until the cap and returned nothing, *twice, costing 4 energy*. Empty replies are no
   longer retried automatically (a retry costs the same again).
4. **AI energy is very limited** (see "Needs your attention"). Background pre-generation pauses when energy is
   below 6; text the player is waiting for still uses it. Later milestones will spend AI only on what matters
   most (notable people, conversations, big moments) and use built-in text for the bulk.
5. **Font:** DejaVu Sans Mono (free licence) rendered into a CP437 tileset at runtime, with hand-drawn
   box lines and shading, so any text size works. Letters are taller than wide (like Brogue / Caves of Qud).
6. **Python 3.12** installed alongside your existing Pythons (3.10/3.11/3.13 untouched), in its own `.venv`.
7. Player settings live in `%APPDATA%\Realmwalker\settings.json`; logs in the project's `logs\` folder when
   run from source, and in `%APPDATA%\Realmwalker\logs` for the packaged game.
8. Debug console on the <code>`</code> key (commands: `help`, `ai on|off`, `offline on|off`, `ping`, `status`,
   `font N`, `test-error`). Switched off in friend builds.

**Needs your attention (when you have a moment)**
- **Player2 energy:** your account showed 10 energy today and a rich AI request costs about 2. Testing used 7
  (the two failed calls above plus one successful call), so 3 are left today. The game works fine without AI, but
  AI text will be rare at this budget. If Player2 lets you pick a different AI model or a higher tier in its own
  app, a cheaper model would stretch the energy much further. Nothing to do otherwise.

**Known issues**
- None open.
